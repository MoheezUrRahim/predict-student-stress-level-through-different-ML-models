**Project Title: Student Stress Level Prediction**

_**Project Description:**_

This project aims to predict the stress level of students based on various factors such as academic performance, lifestyle habits, and personal characteristics. The dataset used for this project contains information about students' demographics, academic records, daily routines, and other relevant attributes.

_**Data:**_

The dataset used for this project is titled "Student Attitude and Behavior.csv". It contains the following features:

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

_**Data Cleaning:**_

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

_**Model Development:**_

Several machine learning models were implemented to predict the stress level:

_**Decision Tree:**_

A decision tree classifier was trained on the preprocessed data.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance.

_**Random Forest:**_

A random forest classifier was trained on the preprocessed data.
The number of trees and other hyperparameters were tuned to improve accuracy.

_**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**_

A KNN classifier was trained on the preprocessed data.
The optimal value of K was determined through cross-validation.

_**Model Evaluation:**_

The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the predictions.

Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. 

Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases. Â  

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the model's performance, showing correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

_**Results and Discussion:**_

The Random Forest model generally outperformed the Decision Tree and KNN models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
Feature engineering techniques, such as creating new features and selecting relevant features, can improve model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing the performance of machine learning models.
Addressing class imbalance, especially for underrepresented stress levels, can be beneficial.
Further exploration of advanced techniques, such as deep learning or ensemble methods, could potentially yield better results.

_**Future Work:**_

Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful information from the data.
Experiment with different hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.
Investigate the use of deep learning models, such as neural networks, for more complex pattern recognition.
Collect more data to improve the model's generalization ability.
Consider incorporating domain knowledge and expert insights to refine the model.

_**Conclusion:**_

This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict student stress levels. The Random Forest model proved to be the most effective in this case, but further research and experimentation are necessary to achieve even higher accuracy and robustness.
